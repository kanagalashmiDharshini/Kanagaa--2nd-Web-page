    <p>The dictionary describes hope as a feeling of expectation and desire for a certain thing to happen.  An Ideal is described as satisfying one's conception of what is perfect; most suitable. In conclusion, it is safe to say that when you combine those two words together you ‚Äúhave an expectation and desire for what is most suitable for yourself.‚Äù Author Julie Neraas describes Hope in this way,

        ‚ÄúHope in contrast with religion, seems refreshingly spacious. It is roomier and more inclusive because it does not require assent to particular beliefs, nor is it wedded to ideology. Indeed, hope, while necessary to our well-being, can exist with equal strength within religious traditions and outside of them.</p>
